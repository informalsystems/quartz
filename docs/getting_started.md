## Introduction

This guide will help you get up and running with an example Quartz application. You can run this locally using a "mock" enclave (without real privacy or attestations), or you can use a machine with Intel SGX enabled for secure execution. We will go over both setups.

> **Note**: This guide assumes familiarity with blockchain concepts and basic smart contract development.

## Quick Start

For those who want to get started quickly with the example Transfers app with
mock SGX:

1. Install dependencies (Rust, docker)
2. Clone the repository: `git clone ssh://git@github.com/informalsystems/cycles-quartz`
3. Run everything: `cd cycles-quartz/docker && docker compose up`
4. On docker desktop, go to the `enclave` logs and copy `contract address` and `pub key` to later setup the Frontend `env.local`
5. Set up the frontend (see [Frontend](#frontend))

For more detailed background and instructions, read on.

## Simple Example - Local Mock SGX Application

Quartz includes a simple example we call the `Transfer` application,
located in [/examples/transfers](/examples/transfers), that comes with a Keplr-based
frontend. It's a simple demo app designed to showcase very basic use of the Quartz framework.
It allows users to deposit funds into a contract,
transfer them privately within the contract's encrypted state (updated by the
enclave),and ultimately withdraw whatever balance they have left or have accumulated.

Every application has a common structure:

1. **Frontend**: The user interface (eg. Next.js, cosmjs / graz)
2. **Contracts**: The backend application as a CosmWasm smart contract
3. **Enclave**: Code that executes off-chain and privately in an enclave

Quartz is both a library (`quartz-contract-core`) for building SGX-aware CosmWasm
contracts, and a cli tool (`quartz`) for managing the enclave.

The library takes care of establishing a secure connection to the enclave (see
[How it Works](/docs/how_it_works.md)), and verifying attestations from
it. The quartz tool provides commands for managing the enclave.

This guide is primarily about using the `quartz` tool to get the example app
setup. For more on building application, see

- [Building Apps](/docs/building_apps.md) - conceptual overview
- [quartz-contract-core](/crates/contracts/core/) - main library. provides msgs and handlers
  for the handshake and for verifying attestations
- [transfers contracts](/examples/transfers/contracts): transfer app example itself

Onwards with the installation and running our example app!

### Installation

Quartz is built in Rust (+wasm32 target). It expects to interact with a CosmWasm compatible
blockchain (eg. `neutrond`), built in Go (or run with Docker).
It also requires a local version of `neutrond` for handling signing keys. And it requires `npm` for
building the frontend. Here we cover how to install Rust, Quartz, and Neutrond. You're responsible for installing Go and NPM (and optionally Docker).

Pre-reqs:

- Git
- Make
- Go or Docker
- NPM

#### Install Rust

The minimum Rust supported version is v1.74.1.
The recommended Rust version v1.79.0.

Install rust [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Check the version with `cargo version`.

Add the wasm32 target:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

And you should be good to go!

#### Install Quartz

Now clone and build the repo:

```bash
git clone ssh://git@github.com/informalsystems/cycles-quartz
cd cycles-quartz
git checkout v0.1.0             # or latest release, check `git tag --sort=-v:refname`
cargo install --path crates/cli
```

And check that it worked:

```bash
quartz --help
```

#### Install Neutrond

A version of `neutrond` is required both for running a node and for managing
keys. Running the node can be done via docker, which is easier to get running,
but the Go binary will have to be installed regardless for signing transactions.

To install the `neutrond` binary:

```bash
git clone -b main https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron.git
cd neutron
git checkout v4.0.1
make install-test-binary
```

You can now start the node either using this version of `neutrond` or using
Docker.

To use your local `neutrond` to run the node, you'll have to setup your
config and genesis files. See the [neutrond setup guide](/docs/neutrond_setup.md), and then return back here and
skip down to the bottom of this section.

Alternatively, you can start the node using docker.

If you're on Mac using Docker Desktop, make sure to enable [host networking](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/host/?uuid=67f19d61-ae59-4996-9060-01ebef9a586c%0A#docker-desktop).

Then:

```bash
cd docker
docker compose up node
```

It will pre-configure a few keys (admin, alice, etc.) and allocate funds to them.
The default sending account for txs is `admin`, as specified in
`examples/transfers/quartz.toml`.
However, these accounts are setup in the docker image. Because we will be deploying our contracts outside of the docker image
we need to have these accounts imported locally. You can do this by install neutrond locally and importing the accounts:

```bash
cd ~
git clone -b main https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron.git
cd neutron/
make install-test-binary

cd cycles-quartz/docker/neutrond
make import-local-accounts
```

Your local `admin` will now be the exact same as the `admin` in the docker image.

Finally, you'll need to import the keys from the docker container into your
local `neutrond`. From inside the `docker` dir:

```bash
tail -n 1 neutrond/data/accounts/admin.txt  | neutrond keys add admin  --no-backup --recover --keyring-backend=test
```

If you already have a key called `admin` in your keystore you'll have to rename it first.

If you want to use a different name then `admin`, be sure to also change it in
the `examples/transfers/quartz.toml` and everywhere we use it below.

Check that the key is there:

```bash
neutrond keys show admin
```

And you're good to go!

### Local neutrond Testnet Without SGX

From the root of the `cycles-quartz` repo, we can now deploy our example
transfers app. Deployment involves three components:

- the enclave
- the smart contract
- the front end

We can deploy the enclave and contract all at once using the `quartz dev`
convenience command (like in the [quick start](#quick-start)), but here we'll
show the individual commands.

### Configure Key

At the moment, we have to do an insecure operation to export the private key to
be used for signing transactions so it can be used by the enclave. This is a
temporary hack.

If you're using docker, the key is hardcoded:

```bash
export ADMIN_SK=ffc4d3c9119e9e8263de08c0f6e2368ac5c2dacecfeb393f6813da7d178873d2
```

Otherwise, you can set the key like so:

```bash
export ADMIN_SK=$(yes | neutrond keys export admin --unsafe --unarmored-hex)
```

Now make sure the key is set:

```bash
echo $ADMIN_SK
```

### Enclave

First we build and run the enclave code.
Quartz provides a `--mock-sgx` flag so we can deploy locally for testing and
development purposes without needing access to an SGX core.

We can run everything from within the `examples/transfers` dir in this repo. To run
from elsewhere by specify a path, eg. from the root of the repo with `--app-dir examples/transfers`.

Now, from `examples/transfers`:

1. Build the enclave binary:

   ```bash
   quartz --mock-sgx enclave build
   ```

2. Start the enclave:
   ```bash
   quartz --mock-sgx enclave start
   ```

If the enclave says `Spawning enclave process....` it is working. Now open another window to
continue.

### Contract

1. Build the contract binary:

   ```bash
   quartz --mock-sgx contract build --contract-manifest "contracts/Cargo.toml"
   ```

2. Deploy the contract:
   ```bash
   quartz --mock-sgx contract deploy \
   --contract-manifest "contracts/Cargo.toml" \
   --init-msg '{"denom":"untrn"}'
   ```

Note our contract takes initialization data in the `--init-msg` which for
the transfers app specifies the asset denom that can be used in this deployment. The
transfers app is currently single asset only.

If successful, it will print the resulting contract address. Save it to an
environment variable:

```bash
export CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
```

3. Perform the handshake:
   ```bash
   quartz --mock-sgx handshake --contract $CONTRACT_ADDRESS
   ```

This will setup a secure connection between the contract and the enclave.

If successful, it should output a pubkey value. We'll need both the contract
address and this pubkey value to configure the frontend. Save this to an
environment variable:

```bash
export PUBKEY=<PUBKEY>
```

Now the contract is ready to start processing requests to the enclave!

The enclave process should be showing logs that it's listening for request.
There's a bug so it won't right now, and will show some error you can ignore.
Good times. Let's move on to setting up the frontend.

### Frontend

You can run the front end on your local computer, so it is easy to test in a browser. If you are running your application in the cloud (such as an Azure SGX machine), you can configure the front end to talk to that blockchain over the internet. You will need node `>= v18.17.0` to build the front end.

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:

   ```bash
   cd examples/transfers/frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

Now open `.env.local` and edit the values of `NEXT_PUBLIC_TRANSFERS_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` and
`NEXT_PUBLIC_ENCLAVE_PUBLIC_KEY` to be the contract address and pubkey from the previous step.
You should have them stored as environment variables `$CONTRACT_ADDRESS` and
`$PUBKEY`. (Note if you ran `quartz dev` instead of all the manual steps you can
get them out of the logs)

4. Finally, start the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Use the App

Open your browser to `localhost:3000` to see the app. You will be prompted to store a mnemonic. This key is stored
in the browser, and allows you to query your encrypted balance in the future. You should save this, but in general
if you are just testing and you don't clear your browser storage, you will be fine.

You'll need to have the Keplr wallet browser extension installed and unlocked.

You may have to go to "Manage Chain Visibility" in Keplr settings to add the
`Local Neutron Testchain` so you can talk to your local chain and see your balance.

Create a new address in Keplr for testing purpose. You'll need to send this
address some funds from the `admin` account setup with your local node. For
instance, send 10M untrn with:

```bash
neutrond tx bank send admin <KEPLR ADDRESS> 10000000untrn --chain-id testing --fees 10000untrn
```

You should now see the funds on your local testnet on Keplr.

Now you can interact with the app by depositing funds, privately transferring
them to other addresses, and finally withdrawing them.

If you want to test multiple addresses, create the other addresses in Keplr and
be sure to send them some `untrn` from the `admin` account so they can pay for
gas.

Be sure to check the enclave window to see the logs from your interaction with
the app!

## Real Testnet with Azure SGX

Now that we've tried the example app on a local testnet with a mocked SGX, it's
time to use a real testnet and a real SGX core. This guide will walk through how
to get setup with SGX on Azure, and how to deploy quartz contracts to the
Neutron testnet using real remote attestations from SGX cores on Azure. Since
this requires setting up an actual SGX setup, its naturally much more
complicated.

Real verification of SGX on a CosmWasm network requires two additional global contracts
to be deployed: `quartz-dcap-verify` and `quartz-tcbinfo`. The
`quartz-dcap-verify` contract provides the core verification of the SGX attestation
(called DCAP). The `quartz-tcbinfo` contract contains global information about secure
versions of SGX processors. Together they allow contracts built with quartz to
securely verify remote attestations from SGX enclaves.

We have already pre-deployed the `quartz-dcap-verify` and `quartz-tcbinfo` contracts on the Neutron
testnet at:

- verifier - `neutron18f3xu4yazfqr48wla9dwr7arn8wfm57qfw8ll6y02qsgmftpft6qfec3uf`
- tcbinfo - `neutron1anj45ushmjntew7zrg5jw2rv0rwfce3nl5d655mzzg8st0qk4wjsds4wps`

To deploy these on your own testnet, see [below](#other-testnets-with-sgx). Although for v0.1, we recommend going with these already deployed contracts.

### Setting up an Azure machine

To begin, you'll need to deploy an SGX-enabled Azure instance and log in via ssh.
Follow the [steps Microsoft lays out](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/quick-create-portal) to connect, choose Ubuntu 20.04, then ssh into the machine.

Once logged in, clone and install Quartz like before (see [installation](#installation)). Once you clone the Quartz repo, you'll have to add some things to your azure machine.

Below we have provided a long instruction set to get the azure machine setup. We plan on dockerizing all of this after the v0.1 launch, as it is quite complex. You can reach out for the team for help if you get stuck here.

```bash

# copy the neutron testnet config file to the default quartz.toml file
cp quartz.neutron_pion-1.toml quartz.toml

# you might want to update the tcbinfo contract you can follow the steps following [this guide from line 32 ](./tcbinfo_and_verifier.md).

# copy the neutron testnet config file to the default quartz.toml file, so we connect to the right nodes
cp quartz.neutron_pion-1.toml quartz.toml
quartz enclave build
quartz enclave start  --unsafe-trust-latest

# build and deploy the contracts
quartz contract build --contract-manifest "contracts/Cargo.toml"
quartz contract deploy --contract-manifest "contracts/Cargo.toml" --init-msg '{"denom":"untrn"}'

# store the output
export CONTRACT=<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>

# create the handshake
quartz handshake --contract $CONTRACT

### ENCLAVE IS SETUP AND RUNNING! CONGRATS!
```

Wahoo! Now follow the instructions in the [Front End section](#frontend) of this doc to test the application with a real enclave.

### Using an enclave on another machine

You can use a remote enclave machine by setting the following env var:

```bash
QUARTZ_NODE_URL=<YOUR_IP_ADDR>:11090
# You can now use that enclave to deploy
cd examples/transfers
quartz contract deploy  --contract-manifest "examples/transfers/contracts/Cargo.toml"   --init-msg '{"denom":"untrn"}'
```

### Other Testnets With SGX

To setup on another testnet we need to deploy a `quartz-tcbinfo` contract and a
`quartz-dcap-verifier` contract. However we recommend using the deployed contracts on neutron public testnet for v0.1.

Instructions can be followed in [this guide](./tcbinfo_and_verifier.md).

## Troubleshooting and FAQ

1. **Q: The enclave fails to start. What should I do?**
   A: Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and that you're using the correct version of each tool.

2. **Q: I'm getting a "contract not found" error during handshake. How do I fix this?**
   A: Double-check that you're using the correct contract address from the deployment step.

3. **Q: The frontend isn't connecting to the blockchain. What's wrong?**
   A: Verify that your `.env.local` file has the correct contract address and public key.

4. **Error in event handler: Unsupported event**
   This error is fine when it appears in the enclave logs, we are working to remove this erroneous message.

For more issues, please refer to our GitHub issues page or community forums.
