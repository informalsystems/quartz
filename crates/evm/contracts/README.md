# Quartz Solidity
A Solidity project for the Quartz contract, utilizing Foundry for testing and deployment. This contract integrates with the DCAP attestation system on the Sepolia testnet, providing secure attestation and session management.

## Prerequisites
Foundry: Install Foundry by running:
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

Environment Variables: Set up a .env file in the project root with your private key and Sepolia RPC URL (alchemy or any other provider):
```
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
RPC_URL_SEPOLIA=https://eth-sepolia.alchemyapi.io/v2/YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY
```

## Testing
Run tests on the Sepolia testnet using Foundry. This command forks the Sepolia network, allowing tests to run against real contract data.
This is so we can easily use the deployed attestation contract on sepolia, and not deploy everything ourselves. It does not require Sepolia ETH, as it forks the blockchain state at that block.

> Note - the tests take about 45 seconds to run on a 2024 Macbook Pro.

```bash
source .env
forge test --fork-url $RPC_URL_SEPOLIA --fork-block-number 7040108
```

## Project Structure
- src/: Contains the Quartz contract source code.
- script/: Deployment scripts using Foundry’s forge script.
- test/: Test files for Quartz contract functions and features.
